## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

- The purpose of this bike sharing company analysis was to highlight the potential success of this type of business in Des Moines to key stakeholders. This analysis was specifically undergone in order to display the characteristics of "bike trips" such as duration, time of day, and location of trips undergone to investors. This analysis would provide more detailed nuances into what could potentially make this business profitable for stakeholders.
âœ“The purpose is well defined.

## Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.

- The results of this visual show that the majority of bikes that were utilized for 20 minutes or less were mainly checked out by men; roughly almost twice as much as women.

- The results of this visual show that the majority of bike trips were undertaken between (7am-9am) and (5pm-6pm) during Monday-Friday; while the majority of trips on the weekend were undertaken betweeen 11am-2pm.

- The results of this visual show that the majority of bikes checked out started and ended in the same area suggesting that many of the bike users could be utilizing the company's services as a means to commute to and from work; as evidence by peak trip times during the week previously mentioned.


## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

- In summary all the conclusions made by these visualizations suggest that this bike sharing company's man user base are working professionals who use this service as a means of commutting to and from work. This is evident by the majority of trips being rented for 20 mins or less, as well as being mainly used between peak daily commute times (7am-9am; 5pm-6pm ) typical of a 9am-5pm occupation. Another key piece of evidence that suggest this conclusion is that mainy of the starting locations of the trips were also very similar ( almost identical ) to the ending locations of the trips; further suggesting a commuter culture in the customer base. Altogether I believe it is reasonable to conclude that many of the user base of this bikesharing company are using bikes to commute to and from work, as this analysis of trip data suggests this through many different variables. There were other significant obersvations made by this analysis, most notably the difference in bike use by gender with males using the service much more than women. Since this is the case, I would recommend another visualization that broke down starting and ending location of trips seperated by gender in order to see what women are mainly using their trips for and if that is different than why men utilize the bikes. I would also recommend another visual of how age and gender influence bike usage.
